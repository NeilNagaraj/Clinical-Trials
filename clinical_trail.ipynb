Clinical Trials.gov, as required  by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web  site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.   Your study doctor is a researcher for this study. As a researcher, he/she is interested both in your  health and how this study is carried out. The study doctor is being paid by Brigham  and  Women’s Hospital (‘the study sponsor’) to carry out this study.   You may ask for a second opinion about your care at any time. You can get this opinion from a  doctor who is not connected with this study.   If you agree to participate in this study, your primary care physician (PCP) /treating physician  will be informed that  you are taking part.   Read this information carefully and please ask the study doctor or the study staff if you  have any questions.   Section 2  What is the background and purpose of the study ?  This study will test whether  the drug dapagliflozin is safe and has beneficial effects when added  to conventional heart failure therapy in patients who have been admitted to the hospital  for acute  heart failure.   Dapagliflozin is a drug that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )  to improve blood su gar control in patients with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of  hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and either cardiovascular disease  or cardiovascular risk factors. Dapagliflozin has also been approved by the FDA  to reduce the  risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart  failure regardless of whether they have diabetes. It has not, however, been studied in patients  hospitalized for acute heart failure. The use of  dapagliflozin in this study is investigational. An  investigational use is one that is not approved by the FDA. This trial will determine if it is safe  and beneficial to start dapagliflozin during  hospital admission  for acute heart failure.    Approximately  2400 other people like you will take part at approximately 150-250 study sites in  the United States , Canada , and Europe . The study is led by the TIMI Study Group, an academic  research organization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School  (Boston,  MA USA).\", \"Brigham and Women's Hospital/TIMI Study Group  / Protocol Number D1690C00078  Page 3 of 21   \\n\\nDawn Lombardo , DO  Advarra IRB Approved Version 28 Oct 2022 Revised 29 Jun 2023    Section 3  What will happen if I take part , and what do I have to do?  You will be asked to take part in this study for 2 months . If you decide to join this study, you  will have a screening visit and 4 study visits.  Screening and Visit 1  (also called randomization)   will take place while you are still in the hospital  and may occur on the same day . After you have  been randomized, you will be asked to return to the study center at o ne (1) week (“Visit 2”), one  (1) month (“Visit 3”) , and two (2)  months  (“Visit 4”) after randomization . At these visits, the  study procedures outlined below  will be performed .   During the study you will be asked to take study drug once a day. You will either receive  dapagliflozin 10 mg or an identical -lookin g placebo  daily . Which study drug you will receive  throughout the study is decided at random by a computer (purely by chance, like flipping  a coin).  You have a 50% chance of receiving dapagliflozin and a 50% chance of receiving placebo. You  and your study doctor will not know which study drug you will receive;  however, the study  doctor can get this information in case of an emergency. To keep you and the study doctor from  knowing which study drug you are taking, this study uses placebo pills. A placebo pill is a tablet  that looks like the study drug but has no medicine.   In this consent form, both dapagliflozin and placebo are described as “ study drug ”.  You cannot participate in any other research s tudies that involve investigational drugs or devices  while participating in this study.   What will happen at each visit during your participation in the study is detailed below.   Screening  visit  Your first visit (called your Screening Visit) will take place  in the hospital. The study team will  explain the study to you  and answer any of your questions. If you want to continue, you will be  asked to sign  and date  this Consent Form agreeing to take part  in the study .  As part of standard care in the hospital, you r height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate will be  measured,  and blood and urine samples will be collected. If some of these tests are not done as  part of your medical care in the hospital, the study doctor may do them to see if you qualify for  this s tudy. If you are a female of childbearing potential, you will be tested to see if you are  pregnant.   The study team  will ask you about your health and your medical history including any  medications you have been taking. The study doctor will review the res ults of the screening  procedures and will tell you if you meet the requirements to continue participation in the study .

Instead, the study doctor uses a code number on the informat ion  sent to the study sponsor. The study sponsor, people who work with the sponsor on  the study, and government agencies and other groups that watch over research  studies like this one may look at all your health information. Regulatory authorities   such as the FDA  may also require that the study doctor turn over to them copies of  all your health information. The reason these people may look at your health  information is to make sure the study has been done the right way. They also want  to make sure that you r health information has been collected the right way, or for  other reasons that are allowed under the law.   Possible Transfer of Your Health Information Out of the Country   As explained above, the study sponsor may send your study data (with a code  number, but not your name) outside of the United States for the reasons described  in this form. Please know that the laws in other countries may not provide the same  level of data protection and may not stop your study data from being disclosed to  others.   Notice on Redisclosure of Your Health Information and Confidentiality   The researchers conducting this research can disclose your protected information  only to the persons whom you have permitted to see it, and only in the ways you  have permitted. However, if you sign and date  this form it is possible that those  persons may share your protected information with other persons.

Instead, the study doctor uses a code number on the informat ion  sent to the study sponsor. The study sponsor, people who work with the sponsor on  the study, and government agencies and other groups that watch over research  studies like this one may look at all your health information. Regulatory authorities   such as the FDA  may also require that the study doctor turn over to them copies of  all your health information. The reason these people may look at your health  information is to make sure the study has been done the right way. They also want  to make sure that you r health information has been collected the right way, or for  other reasons that are allowed under the law.   Possible Transfer of Your Health Information Out of the Country   As explained above, the study sponsor may send your study data (with a code  number, but not your name) outside of the United States for the reasons described  in this form.

The study is being conducted by the Brigham and Women's Hospital/TIMI Study Group and is approved by the Advarra IRB and the University of California, Irvine.\\n\\nThe study aims to investigate the potential benefits and risks of using Dapagliflozin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, in patients with acute heart failure. The researchers want to determine if initiating Dapagliflozin during hospitalization can improve clinical outcomes, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular events or improving overall heart function, in these patients.\\n\\nTo achieve this, the study will involve a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Dapagliflozin or a placebo, and their clinical outcomes will be monitored over a period of time. The study will also compare the effects of Dapagliflozin to standard practice in the treatment of acute heart failure.\\n\\nThe study protocol includes various procedures, such as study visits, laboratory tests, and other research-related tests and procedures, which will be provided at no cost to the participants. However, any routine medical care related to the participants' existing medical conditions will be billed to them or their health plan/insurance.\\n\\nParticipants in the study have the right to be fully informed about the nature and purpose of the study, the procedures involved, any potential risks or side effects, and any potential benefits they may receive from participating. They also have the right to ask questions and to refuse participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits.\\n\\nThe study emphasizes the voluntary nature of participation and ensures that participants have the opportunity to freely decide whether or not to consent to the research study. The researchers are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of participants' personal health information, although there is a possibility that unauthorized individuals may have access to it.\\n\\nOverall, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential benefits and risks of using Dapagliflozin in patients with acute heart failure and to provide valuable insights for improving the treatment and management of this condition.\""

      "\n",
      "Dronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV hospitalization in patients with AF or atrial flutter. However, it is unknown if dronedarone (or any antiarrhythmic medication) can reduce CV hospitalization or death in patients with first-detected AF. This trial has been designed to address this important question. In order to facilitate the trial enrollment, data collection, and a generalizability to clinical practice, the CHANGE AFIB study has been designed as an open-label pragmatic clinical trial nested within the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Atrial Fibrillation registry. At present the overall GWTG program is being implemented in over 2,300 hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of over 9 million patient records, with an estimated 650,000 new patient records entered per year. The trial will utilize the existing GWTG registry network, data collection architecture, and experience to facilitate both enrollment and conduct of the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comparator arm will be \"usual care.\" Thus, this study will compare usual care plus dronedarone versus usual care alone. In most patients, the investigators anticipate usual care to include an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or digoxin) without an antiarrhythmic. As dronedarone has anti-adrenergic rate controlling properties, a low dose of beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker is recommended in the USPI when starting dronedarone. In the dronedarone arm concomitant digoxin use will be contraindicated due to P-gp interaction based upon data from the PALLAS trial. All patients will receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention according to current guideline recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHANGE AFIB will leverage several critical advantages as a pragmatic clinical trial. Data collection will be integrated into the Get With The Guidelines AFIB registry. The use of the GWTG-AFIB registry will also enhance subject recruitment and ensure the enrollment of a diverse group of patients. The randomized intervention will be compared with usual care thus further enhancing generalizability. Follow-up visits will be minimized to reduce patient burden. Moreover, follow-up visits will have \"windows\" to accommodate variation in follow-up intervals at different centers.\n",

The goal of Phase I is to examine the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects. The goal of Phase II is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of ACTH release by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to suppress the HPA axis?

       " 'DESCRIPTION': 'Purpose:\\n\\nOpioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.\\n\\nThis research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH. By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.\\n\\nThere are 3 study groups: (1) low dose remifentanil (LO, 0.1 micrograms/kg/mL), (2) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with placebo (HI, 0.4 micrograms/kg/mL), or (3) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with ultra-low dose naloxone (HN, 0.004 micrograms/kg/mL naloxone).\\n\\nBackground:\\n\\nOpioid-induced hyperalgesia is a paradoxical increase in pain sensitivity following opioid exposure. The mechanism for this is likely due to an alteration in opioid receptor signaling with disruption of G-protein coupling and opioid-induced activation and hypertrophy of spinal glial cells (gliosis). Opioid-induced hyperalgesia has been noted with many different opioids, and the most well documented hyperalgesic effect is with remifentanil.\\n\\nVarious agents have been used in an attempt to reduce the development hyperalgesia following remifentanil. While there are few reports on the effect of ultra-low dose naloxone on opioid-induced hyperalgesia, recent evidence is emerging regarding its use in pain management. Ultra-low dose naloxone has been shown to prevent remifentanil-induced pain hypersensitivities (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in rats. However, there are little to no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with naloxone in human subjects.\\n\\nExisting knowledge and previous research:\\n\\nAttempts have been made with various agents to reduce the development of tolerance and hyperalgesia following remifentanil. Postoperative hyperalgesia and its prevention has been studied with ketamine , Magnesium , Gabapentin, Clonidine, Lornoxicam , Dextromethorphan , Paracetamol , Morphine , Dexmedetomidine , Adenosine, COX inhibitors , Amantadine , Nitrous oxide, Fentanyl, Pregabalin , Buprenorphine, Midazolam, Dexamethasone. Relevant to our current hypothesis is the report that concomitant administration of ultra-low dose naloxone and naltrexone with remifentanil prevented OIH. However, there are no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with ultra-low dose naloxone in human subjects.\\n\\nWhile the traditional role of opiate antagonists have been in cases of opioid overmedication, recent evidence is emerging regarding their use in pain management. Gan et al. 1997 used an ultra-low dose naloxone infusion (0.00025 mg/kg/h or 0.001 mg/kg/h) in postoperative patients receiving IV morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Good pain relief was experienced in all groups, however consumption of PCA morphine was significantly reduced in patients that received the lowest infusion of naloxone and opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) were reduced by naloxone at both dose.\\n\\nNaloxone and/or naltrexone at ultra-low doses may enhance the analgesic effects of opioids, enhance the antinociceptive effects of methadone, and decrease or block the development of opioid tolerance in rodents. The combination of oxycodone with an ultra-low dose of the antagonist naltrexone as a singular oral medication, Oxytrex, has been developed to prevent the development of tolerance in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.\\n\\nAguado et. al. 2013 recently evaluated the effects of the opioid antagonist, naloxone, on remifentanil-induced tolerance or hyperalgesia in rats. Hyperalgesia was considered to be a decrease in mechanical nociceptive thresholds (von Frey), while opioid tolerance was considered to be a decrease in sevoflurane MAC reduction by remifentanil. An ultra-low dose of naloxone was able to block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and the MAC increase associated with hyperalgesia, but did not change opioid tolerance under inhaled anesthesia.',\n",

HCV antibody (for Hepatitis C) and Hepatitis B Surface antigen and Hepatitis B core antibody must be negative. This has been routinely incorporated into immunotherapy trials with checkpoint inhibitors because of concerns that the risk of treatment-induced hepatic injury is increased in the setting of active viral hepatitis.\\n* The participant must not be on a corticosteroid dose greater than physiologic replacement dosing defined as 30 mg of cortisone per day or its equivalent.\\n* The participant must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry. No Durable Power of Attorney or Next of Kin can provide initial consent.\\n* The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\\n\\nNOTE: Based on the evidence cited in Nivolumab IB ver. 20, given that nivolumab is not a genotoxic agent, and that relevant systemic concentrations sufficient to produce a risk of fetal toxicity are not expected in WOCBP partners from exposure to a male participant s seminal fluid, male study participants will not be required to use contraceptive measures and/or a latex or other synthetic condom during sexual activity with a WOCBP partner.\\n\\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\\n\\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\\n* Prior use of an immunotherapy such as (but not limited to) a vaccine therapy, dendritic cell vaccine, other checkpoint inhibitors, or intracavitary or convectional enhanced delivery of chemotherapy.\\n* Prior or concurrent malignancy unless its natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen.\\n* Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\\n\\n  * Unstable angina within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration.\\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration.\\n  * Evidence of recent myocardial infarction or ischemia by the findings of S-T elevations of \\\\>= 2 mm using the analysis of an EKG performed within 14 days prior to Step 2 registration.\\n  * New York Heart Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within 12 months prior to Step 2 registration.\\n  * History of stroke, cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Step 2 registration, with the exception of pericavitary ischemia due to tumor resection.\\n  * Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia.\\n  * Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection) or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.\\n  * Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.\\n  * Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture or history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration, with the exception of the craniotomy for tumor resection.\\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration.\\n  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration.\\n  * Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects.\\n  * Known acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude participants with AIDS is based on the lack of information regarding the safety of nivolumab in patients with active HIV infection.\\n  * Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, which in the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for immunologic toxicity.\\n* Participants with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to participants with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or CIDP, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn s, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and participants with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease.\\n\\nOf note, participants with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Participants with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible. However, patients with vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis on appropriate replacement therapy may be enrolled.\\n\\n* Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.\\n* Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction: History of allergy to study drug components.\\n* Pregnancy or lactating females due to possible adverse effects on the developing fetus or infant due to study drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to Step 2 registration.\\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\\n* Participants unable to have MRIs. Description: Background:\\n\\n* There are more than 130 identified primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Most have an annual incidence of less than 1000 in the United States.\\n* Given the rarity of each of the tumors listed above, there is a paucity of proven therapies. Most of these neoplasms are treated with maximum surgical resection followed by treatment with external beam radiotherapy. With few exceptions (medulloblastoma, adult ependymoma), there are no effective systemic regimens and even in chemotherapy sensitive disease, most patients with recurrence eventually have no remaining salvage treatments available.\\n* In the setting of this unmet need, we propose to create a basket protocol that will evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with refractory rare central nervous system neoplasms.\\n* This study seeks to establish effective therapies at recurrence in patients with rare CNS tumors. We hypothesize that this therapy will improve progression free survival and/or objective responses.\\n* It will be important to determine whether any determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of symptoms offset the increase in survival. Precedence exists for measuring non-therapeutic endpoints in oncology research, and specifically in studies evaluating therapeutic benefit in patients with CNS tumors. There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and Spine Tumor Module (MDASI-SP) allow for the self-reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities for patients with either brain or spinal cord tumors. The availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nDetermine the efficacy of nivolumab in a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors as measured by disease control rate (confirmed CR/PR or durable SD for at least 6 months).\\n\\nEligibility:\\n\\n* Documented recurrent or progressive disease that corresponds to one of the tumors eligible for testing.\\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\\n* Karnofsky Performance greater than or equal to 70%.\\n* Tumor tissue available for central review to confirm morphologic diagnosis\\n* Tumor tissue or slides must be available for central molecular and immune profiling.\\n\\nDesign:\\n\\n* This is an open label phase II clinical trial. Patients will be treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, at a standard dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) for cycles 1 through 2, then doses of 480 mg every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) for a total of 14 additional doses (cycles). A maximum of 18 treatments will be given (64 weeks).\\n* A cycle will be defined as 4 weeks and patients will undergo efficacy assessments using MR imaging (and/or other imaging tests if applicable) every 2 cycles. Toxicity assessments will occur before the initiation of each cycle and patient outcomes measures (PROs) will be completed at the time of each imaging study (every 2 cycles) but prior to the patient being informed of the imaging results.\\n* After completion of the planned treatment course or if treatment was stopped because of toxicity, patients will undergo imaging evaluations and PRO measurements every 8 weeks (or 2 months) for one year, then every 3 months for the next year, then every 4\\n\\nmonths for the next year and then every 6 months while the patient remains on the protocol. Patients off treatment because of disease progression will not undergo future imaging or PRO assessments on this protocol.\\n\\n* Bayesian Optimal Phase 2 design (BOP2), will be used to conduct this phase II trial in patients with a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors.\\n* The study will be comprised of 2 disease cohorts: heavily pretreated (defined as having received 3 or more prior therapies) and non-heavily pretreated (defined as having received up to 2 prior therapies). Each cohort will be evaluated\\n\\nindependently for efficacy. Summary: Background:\\n\\nMore than 130 primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Most affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors.\\n\\nObjectives:\\n\\nTo learn if stimulating the immune system using the drug nivolumab can shrink tumors in people with rare CNS (brain or spine) tumors or increase the time it takes for these tumors to grow or spread.\\n\\nEligibility:\\n\\nAdults whose rare CNS tumor has returned.\\n\\nDesign:\\n\\nParticipants will be screened:\\n\\n* Heart and blood tests\\n* Physical and neurological exam\\n* Hepatitis tests\\n* Pregnancy test\\n* MRI. They will lay in a machine that takes pictures.\\n* Tumor tissue sample. This can be from a previous procedure.\\n\\nAt the start of the study, participants will have blood tests. They will answer questions about their symptoms and their quality of life.\\n\\nParticipants will get nivolumab in a vein every 2 weeks for up to 64 weeks.\\n\\nParticipants will have monthly blood tests. Every other month they will have an MRI and a neurologic function test. They will also answer questions about their quality of life.\\n\\nGenetic tests will be done on participants' tumor tissue. Participants will be contacted if any clinically important results are found.\\n\\nAfter treatment ends, participants will be monitored for up to 5 years. They will have a series of MRIs and neurological function tests. They will be asked to report any symptoms they experience....

Description: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\\n\\nI. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs overall survival (OS) versus (vs.) standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with MGMT promoter methylation.\\n\\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\\n\\nI. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) vs. standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.\\n\\nII.

To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) is associated with inferior short-term change in patient reported outcomes (PROs) as measured by MDASI-BT vs. standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.\\n\\nIV. To assess toxicity in the two different chemotherapy regimens.\\n\\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\\n\\nI. To assess the association between absolute lymphocyte counts and outcomes. II. To assess the association between CD4+ lymphocyte counts and outcomes. III. To compare the two different chemotherapy regimens in terms of long-term PROs as measured by MDASI-BT at years 1 and 2.\\n\\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\\n\\nARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\\n\\nARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lomustine PO on day 1 and temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\\n\\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1, every 4 months for year 2, and then every 6 months thereafter. Summary: This phase III trial compares the effect of adding lomustine to temozolomide and radiation therapy versus temozolomide and radiation therapy alone in shrinking or stabilizing newly diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding lomustine to usual treatment of temozolomide and radiation therapy may help shrink and stabilize glioblastoma.
