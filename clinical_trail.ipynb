Clinical Trials.gov, as required  by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web  site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.   Your study doctor is a researcher for this study. As a researcher, he/she is interested both in your  health and how this study is carried out. The study doctor is being paid by Brigham  and  Women’s Hospital (‘the study sponsor’) to carry out this study.   You may ask for a second opinion about your care at any time. You can get this opinion from a  doctor who is not connected with this study.   If you agree to participate in this study, your primary care physician (PCP) /treating physician  will be informed that  you are taking part.   Read this information carefully and please ask the study doctor or the study staff if you  have any questions.   Section 2  What is the background and purpose of the study ?  This study will test whether  the drug dapagliflozin is safe and has beneficial effects when added  to conventional heart failure therapy in patients who have been admitted to the hospital  for acute  heart failure.   Dapagliflozin is a drug that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )  to improve blood su gar control in patients with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of  hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and either cardiovascular disease  or cardiovascular risk factors. Dapagliflozin has also been approved by the FDA  to reduce the  risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart  failure regardless of whether they have diabetes. It has not, however, been studied in patients  hospitalized for acute heart failure. The use of  dapagliflozin in this study is investigational. An  investigational use is one that is not approved by the FDA. This trial will determine if it is safe  and beneficial to start dapagliflozin during  hospital admission  for acute heart failure.    Approximately  2400 other people like you will take part at approximately 150-250 study sites in  the United States , Canada , and Europe . The study is led by the TIMI Study Group, an academic  research organization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School  (Boston,  MA USA).\", \"Brigham and Women's Hospital/TIMI Study Group  / Protocol Number D1690C00078  Page 3 of 21   \\n\\nDawn Lombardo , DO  Advarra IRB Approved Version 28 Oct 2022 Revised 29 Jun 2023    Section 3  What will happen if I take part , and what do I have to do?  You will be asked to take part in this study for 2 months . If you decide to join this study, you  will have a screening visit and 4 study visits.  Screening and Visit 1  (also called randomization)   will take place while you are still in the hospital  and may occur on the same day . After you have  been randomized, you will be asked to return to the study center at o ne (1) week (“Visit 2”), one  (1) month (“Visit 3”) , and two (2)  months  (“Visit 4”) after randomization . At these visits, the  study procedures outlined below  will be performed .   During the study you will be asked to take study drug once a day. You will either receive  dapagliflozin 10 mg or an identical -lookin g placebo  daily . Which study drug you will receive  throughout the study is decided at random by a computer (purely by chance, like flipping  a coin).  You have a 50% chance of receiving dapagliflozin and a 50% chance of receiving placebo. You  and your study doctor will not know which study drug you will receive;  however, the study  doctor can get this information in case of an emergency. To keep you and the study doctor from  knowing which study drug you are taking, this study uses placebo pills. A placebo pill is a tablet  that looks like the study drug but has no medicine.   In this consent form, both dapagliflozin and placebo are described as “ study drug ”.  You cannot participate in any other research s tudies that involve investigational drugs or devices  while participating in this study.   What will happen at each visit during your participation in the study is detailed below.   Screening  visit  Your first visit (called your Screening Visit) will take place  in the hospital. The study team will  explain the study to you  and answer any of your questions. If you want to continue, you will be  asked to sign  and date  this Consent Form agreeing to take part  in the study .  As part of standard care in the hospital, you r height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate will be  measured,  and blood and urine samples will be collected. If some of these tests are not done as  part of your medical care in the hospital, the study doctor may do them to see if you qualify for  this s tudy. If you are a female of childbearing potential, you will be tested to see if you are  pregnant.

Instead, the study doctor uses a code number on the informat ion  sent to the study sponsor. The study sponsor, people who work with the sponsor on  the study, and government agencies and other groups that watch over research  studies like this one may look at all your health information. Regulatory authorities   such as the FDA  may also require that the study doctor turn over to them copies of  all your health information. The reason these people may look at your health  information is to make sure the study has been done the right way. They also want  to make sure that you r health information has been collected the right way, or for  other reasons that are allowed under the law.   Possible Transfer of Your Health Information Out of the Country   As explained above, the study sponsor may send your study data (with a code  number, but not your name) outside of the United States for the reasons described  in this form. Please know that the laws in other countries may not provide the same  level of data protection and may not stop your study data from being disclosed to  others.   Notice on Redisclosure of Your Health Information and Confidentiality   The researchers conducting this research can disclose your protected information  only to the persons whom you have permitted to see it, and only in the ways you  have permitted. However, if you sign and date  this form it is possible that those  persons may share your protected information with other persons.

Instead, the study doctor uses a code number on the informat ion  sent to the study sponsor. The study sponsor, people who work with the sponsor on  the study, and government agencies and other groups that watch over research  studies like this one may look at all your health information. Regulatory authorities   such as the FDA  may also require that the study doctor turn over to them copies of  all your health information. The reason these people may look at your health  information is to make sure the study has been done the right way. They also want  to make sure that you r health information has been collected the right way, or for  other reasons that are allowed under the law.   Possible Transfer of Your Health Information Out of the Country   As explained above, the study sponsor may send your study data (with a code  number, but not your name) outside of the United States for the reasons described  in this form. Please know that the laws in other countries may not provide the same  level of data protection and may not stop your study data from being disclosed to  others.   Notice on Redisclosure of Your Health Information and Confidentiality   The researchers conducting this research can disclose your protected information  only to the persons whom you have permitted to see it, and only in the ways you  have permitted.

Publication of Study Results   Your health information will be kept confidential at all times, except when  disclosure is required by law. The results from this study may also be presented at  meetings or in articles.

       "\"The background and purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of in-hospital initiation of Dapagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients who have been stabilized during hospitalization for acute heart failure. The study is being conducted by the Brigham and Women's Hospital/TIMI Study Group and is approved by the Advarra IRB and the University of California, Irvine.\\n\\nThe study aims to investigate the potential benefits and risks of using Dapagliflozin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, in patients with acute heart failure. The researchers want to determine if initiating Dapagliflozin during hospitalization can improve clinical outcomes, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular events or improving overall heart function, in these patients.\\n\\nTo achieve this, the study will involve a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Dapagliflozin or a placebo, and their clinical outcomes will be monitored over a period of time. The study will also compare the effects of Dapagliflozin to standard practice in the treatment of acute heart failure.\\n\\nThe study protocol includes various procedures, such as study visits, laboratory tests, and other research-related tests and procedures, which will be provided at no cost to the participants. However, any routine medical care related to the participants' existing medical conditions will be billed to them or their health plan/insurance.\\n\\nParticipants in the study have the right to be fully informed about the nature and purpose of the study, the procedures involved, any potential risks or side effects, and any potential benefits they may receive from participating. They also have the right to ask questions and to refuse participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits.\\n\\nThe study emphasizes the voluntary nature of participation and ensures that participants have the opportunity to freely decide whether or not to consent to the research study. The researchers are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of participants' personal health information, although there is a possibility that unauthorized individuals may have access to it.\\n\\nOverall, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential benefits and risks of using Dapagliflozin in patients with acute heart failure and to provide valuable insights for improving the treatment and management of this condition.\""

      "\n",
      "Dronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV hospitalization in patients with AF or atrial flutter. However, it is unknown if dronedarone (or any antiarrhythmic medication) can reduce CV hospitalization or death in patients with first-detected AF. This trial has been designed to address this important question. In order to facilitate the trial enrollment, data collection, and a generalizability to clinical practice, the CHANGE AFIB study has been designed as an open-label pragmatic clinical trial nested within the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Atrial Fibrillation registry. At present the overall GWTG program is being implemented in over 2,300 hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of over 9 million patient records, with an estimated 650,000 new patient records entered per year. The trial will utilize the existing GWTG registry network, data collection architecture, and experience to facilitate both enrollment and conduct of the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comparator arm will be \"usual care.\" Thus, this study will compare usual care plus dronedarone versus usual care alone. In most patients, the investigators anticipate usual care to include an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or digoxin) without an antiarrhythmic. As dronedarone has anti-adrenergic rate controlling properties, a low dose of beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker is recommended in the USPI when starting dronedarone. In the dronedarone arm concomitant digoxin use will be contraindicated due to P-gp interaction based upon data from the PALLAS trial. All patients will receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention according to current guideline recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHANGE AFIB will leverage several critical advantages as a pragmatic clinical trial. Data collection will be integrated into the Get With The Guidelines AFIB registry. The use of the GWTG-AFIB registry will also enhance subject recruitment and ensure the enrollment of a diverse group of patients. The randomized intervention will be compared with usual care thus further enhancing generalizability. Follow-up visits will be minimized to reduce patient burden. Moreover, follow-up visits will have \"windows\" to accommodate variation in follow-up intervals at different centers.\n",
